			   lilies are growen in large number
Lily bulbs can be planted in spring, but getting them into the ground in autumn gives them a head start.
 Because they are stem rooters and the bulb often anchors a heavy blossom load, it’s critical to sink it at least 8 to 10 inches from top of bulb to top of soil.
  In regions where temperatures skyrocket above 90 degrees F on a daily basis, sink the bulbs an extra 4 inches or so deeper.
